# Telco Churn

# Project Description

* Does contract type play a role in higher customer churn?

    * Drop unnecessary columns. 
    * Replace white space and convert data types.
    * Encode attributes to fit in ML format.
    * split data into train, validate and test (approximatley 56/24/20)

* Explore Data
    * Use graph and hypothesis testing to find churn, driving factors of churn, and answer the following initial questions
        * Do customers who churn have a higher average monthly charge than customers who do not churn?
        * Does contract type play a role in higher customer churn?
        * Do customers with tech support likely to churn less?

* Develop Model
    * Use driving attributes to create labels
    * Set up baseline prediction
    * Evaluate models on train data and validate data
    * Select the best model based on the highest accuracy 
    * Evaluate the best model on test data to make predictions

* Draw Conclusions

# Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repo 
2. To acquire data, need to have access to to MYSQL database of codeup. 
3. Data can be also be acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn), save a file as 'telco.csv' and put the file into the cloned repo 
5. Run notebook

# Takeaways and Conclusions
* Customer churn is about 27%.
* Gender and Phone service are not driving customer churn.
* online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, internet service type, tenure, monthly charges, and total charges are main drivers of customer churn.
* Customers with high monthly charges churn in higher ratio.
* Contract type is one of main driver of customer churn. Customers with contract type of month-to-month churn in higher ratio than customers with other contract type
* Customers with add on : online security, online backup, device protection, and tech support churn less than customers who do do not have those add on.

# Recommendations
* Run programs or offers that increase customer to sign one year or two year contract. Customers with contract of monht-to-month churn in higher ration than customers with contract of one year or two year.
* Maintian constant monthly charges or lower monthly charges to retain customer who churn when monthly charge increases.
* Customer with additional package like online security, online backup, device protection, and tech support tends to less churn so run programs that increase customer to add those packages.
